bug description:
I am trying to figure out how to write Jade 
so I follow the tutorial on the website:
http://cssdeck.com/labs/learning-the-jade-templating-engine-syntax

The code is running on the website and it works.

However, when I creat a jade file called: test.jade in KiwiMT
and trying to run it(I change the beignning "!!! 5" to "doctype html"),
it always has a bug called:

unexpected text ;
   6| style
   7| body {
 > 8| font-family: Verdana;
   9| font-size: 13px;
   10| background: #eee;
   11| }

 it seems someone in Github has the same situation like I do ,
 the parser of jade has some problems:
 https://github.com/jadejs/jade/issues/1347

 I am trying to fix it.

Bug solution: I am using two hours to check all the web and document.
Nobody says anything about the inline css,
I will facebook the author of Jade later.
But right now, I am assuing you are not allowed to directly write internal 
css in jade.
